# Hannah — 23 & Me (Birthday Edition)

A lightweight, GitHub Pages-friendly birthday surprise site.

Flow:
- Welcome → Sequencing → 6 Traits (with photos) → Final Result → World Map (clickable USA + Korea) → Unlock “Us — 100%” Moon

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / `/root`.
3. Open the Pages URL.

Everything is static: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, and `assets/`.

## Notes
- The world map is an SVG (Simplemaps format). USA is represented by multiple paths with the class `United States`; Korea is the path with id `KR`.
- Photos live in `assets/photos/`.
